</header>
<h3>A. Terms of Use</h3>
<p>1) <strong>INTRODUCTION</strong>. These terms of use, as amended from time to time, are a legal agreement between FDI, its affiliates and any of their respective successors or assigns (collectively, "FDI," "we" or "us") and you regarding your use of FDI's websites or applications created or controlled by FDI (collectively, the "Services"). The Services are offered to you by FDI and its development and technology partners, suppliers, service providers, licensors and licensees (collectively, "Third Party Providers") who may assist in the development, hosting, operation, distribution, marketing, publication or exploitation of the Services. Your access to and the use of the Services is subject to your acceptance of the terms, conditions, policies and notices contained herein (the "Agreement"). Your access to and use of the Services constitutes your acceptance, without modification, of this Agreement and also our Privacy Policy. In addition, we require your express acceptance to this Agreement and the Privacy Policy, the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference, when you register to access and use the Services. If you do not agree to be bound by this Agreement or the Privacy Policy, then you are not permitted to register for access or use of the Services and are not to use or access the Services.</p>
<p>2) <strong>GRANT OF LIMITED LICENSE TO USE THE SERVICES</strong>.<br>
    Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you are hereby granted a limited non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license during the term of this Agreement to access and use the Services. ALL RIGHTS NOT EXPRESSLY GRANTED IN THIS AGREEMENT ARE RESERVED BY FDI. FDI reserves the right to interrupt all or any aspect of Services from time to time on a regularly scheduled basis or otherwise with or without prior notice, for any reason (or no reason), including, without limitation, in order to perform maintenance. You understand and agree that delays and disruptions of other network transmissions are completely beyond our control. You acknowledge that the Services may also be interrupted for reasons beyond the control of FDI and FDI cannot guarantee that you will be able to access the Services or your User Account (as defined below) whenever you may wish to do so. FDI has the right at any time for any reason or no reason to change and/or eliminate any aspect of the Services as FDI shall determine at its discretion. Solely for purposes of clarity and without limiting or waiving any term or condition set forth elsewhere in this Agreement, we are entitled, with immediate effect, to block your access to the Services where you use the Services in a manner that violates applicable law or in a manner that FDI determines is a breach this Agreement. Your right to access and use the Services is provided at our discretion, and your account may be suspended or terminated at any time and for any reason. Only individuals may apply for registration, and organizations or companies are not eligible to register for Services without the express written permission of FDI, which it may withhold in its discretion.</p>
<p>3) <strong>ELIGIBILITY</strong>. You are only eligible to register for certain Services if you meet certain requirements as set forth at the time of registration. If you do not meet such requirements, then you may not register for Services.</p>
<p>4) <strong>USER ACCOUNT</strong>. Certain content and Services that FDI may offer or that you may wish to access will require that you first register with FDI and create an account ("User Account"), although many Services are accessible without the requirement of a User Account. This Agreement applies equally to your access to and use of the Services without establishing a User Account as well as your access to and/or use of the Services for which a User Account is required.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">a) <strong>Establishing a User Account</strong>. To establish a User Account, you may be required to provide FDI with certain personal information, including without limitation, your first and last name, date of birth, e-mail address, account information for certain third party sites or networks such as Facebook or Twitter, phone numbers (including cell phone numbers), mailing address and zip code that may be used to identify you as an authorized user of the Service. You agree that you will supply accurate information to FDI when requested, and that you will update that information promptly if it changes. FDI reserves all rights to pursue legal action against all persons who misrepresent personal information or who are otherwise untruthful about their identity, and to suspend or cancel User Accounts registered with inaccurate or incomplete information.<br>
    b) <strong>Login Information</strong>. During the registration process, you may be required to select a username and a password (collectively, "Login Information"). It is important that you remember your Login Information and that you keep your Login Information in a safe and secure offline location. You may not share or transfer your User Account or the Login Information with anyone other than as expressly set forth in this Agreement. You are responsible for protecting the confidentiality of the Login Information, and you will be responsible for all use of your User Account accessed with your Login Information, whether or not authorized by you. Any unauthorized access, use, distribution or transfer of your User Account or Login Information may result in suspension, termination, or cancellation of your User Account and your access to and use of the Services.<br>
    c) <strong>Security of Your User Account and Login Information</strong>. In the event that you become aware of or suspect unauthorized use of your User Account or Login Information or any other breach of security, you agree to immediately notify FDI of such use pursuant to the Notice provision below, and ensure that you secure your User Account, Login Information and computer from unauthorized access and use. Once we are notified of any unauthorized use or breach of security, we will attempt to reset your Login Information, which may require you to provide us with a new username or password. In accordance with our Privacy Policy, we have implemented technical, administrative and physical security measures to help safeguard and prevent unauthorized access, use or disclosure of your personal information. Although we use reasonable efforts to safeguard the security of your personal information, transmissions made on or through the Internet and personal information stored on our servers or the servers of Third Party Providers that we may use are vulnerable to attack and cannot be guaranteed to be secure. In addition, submissions made via email are not protected by encryption and are vulnerable to interception during transmission. To the extent allowed by law, FDI hereby disclaims any liability for security breaches, access to or disclosure of your personal information or the unavailability of the Service or any delay or failure to perform resulting from any causes whatsoever.<br>
    d) <strong>No Ownership of Your User Account</strong>. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO OWNERSHIP OR OTHER PROPERTY INTEREST IN YOUR USER ACCOUNT, AND THAT ALL RIGHTS IN AND TO THE USER ACCOUNTS ARE AND SHALL FOREVER BE OWNED BY AND INURE TO THE BENEFIT OF FDI.</p>
<p>5) <strong>CODE OF CONDUCT</strong>. Your use of the Services is governed by certain rules (the "Code of Conduct") maintained and enforced by or on behalf of FDI and to which you (and all users) must adhere. It is your responsibility to know, understand and abide by the Code of Conduct. The following rules are not meant to be exhaustive. In addition to the conduct specified below, FDI reserves the right, in its discretion, to take disciplinary or other measures as it sees fit in response to conduct that it deems unacceptable, including, without limitation, to delete or alter any username or the suspension, termination, or cancellation of your User Account and your access to and use of the Services, or terminate any license granted in this Agreement, for any reason whatsoever. FDI reserves the right to modify the Code of Conduct at any time.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">a) <strong>Unacceptable Online Conduct</strong>. Any attempt by you to disrupt, or encourage or promote the disruption of the Services may be a violation of criminal and civil laws. You agree that you will not violate any applicable law, rule or regulation in connection with your use of the Services, nor will you interrupt or attempt to interrupt the operation of the Services in any way, including without limitation, the following:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">i) use any unauthorized third-party that intercepts, or otherwise collects, information from or through the Services;<br>
    ii) modify or cause to be modified any files that are a part of the Services in any way;<br>
    iii) facilitate, create or maintain any unauthorized connection to the Services; or<br>
    iv) disrupt or assist in the disruption of any computer used to support the Services or another individual's access to or use of the Services.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">b) <strong>Username Rules</strong>. FDI may change your username, block your registration, remove your username from all aspects the Service, and/or suspend or terminate your access to the Service if FDI determines, at its discretion, that your username is contrary to the terms of this Agreement, including, without limitation, the requirements set forth in this Section 5. You may not use any name:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">i) that belongs to another person with the intent to impersonate that person or that may mislead others to believe you to be the other person an employee of FDI;<br>
    ii) that uses vulgar or insulting language or which is otherwise offensive, defamatory, obscene, hateful, or racially, ethnically, or religiously charged, or other language FDI considers objectionable;<br>

    iv) that is, contains, or is substantially similar to, a trademark or service mark, whether registered or not; or<br>
    v) that is related to drugs, sex, alcohol, or criminal activity.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">c) <strong>Rules Related to Use of Games, Apps and Other Content available as part of the Services</strong>. If you download or otherwise access a game or online application (commonly known as an "app") or any other content from the provider of that app (collectively, "Third Party Channels") and breach the terms and conditions associated with the access and use of such Third Party Channels, or otherwise use or access such game app or content in a manner that FDI deems inappropriate, then your User Account may be immediately terminated or suspended.</p>
<p>6) <strong>COMMUNICATION AND OTHER FEATURES AVAILABLE IN CONNECTION WITH GAMES, APPS AND OTHER CONTENT AVAILABLE AS PART OF THE SERVICES</strong>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">a) <strong>Communication Features</strong>. When using or accessing Third Party Channels, you understand that you may be exposed to messages, information, data, text, software, graphic files, advertising or other materials, whether in written, verbal, electronic, digital, machine-readable or other form (whether now known or hereafter to become known) from other users ("Third Party User Material") and that you might find such Third Party User Material objectionable. FDI and its Third Party Providers do not control the content of any Third Party User Material and do not guarantee its accuracy, integrity or quality. You understand that any Third Party User Material sent through or appearing on the Third Party Channels is the sole responsibility of those users or persons transmitting such Third Party User Material. This means that you, and not FDI or its Third Party Providers, are entirely responsible for all Third Party User Material that you transmit or receive. Under no circumstances will FDI or its Third Party Providers be liable for any errors or omissions in any Third Party User Material or for any loss or damages of any kind incurred as a result of the access to, downloading, viewing, listening, use of or inability to use any Third Party User Material. FDI and its Third Party Providers have no obligation to monitor or supervise Third Party User Material, and expressly disclaim any representation that they will monitor or supervise such Third Party User Material. You agree that you have no expectation of privacy in connection with any Third Party User Material. You also agree to indemnify and defend and hold FDI and its Third Party Providers harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys' fees, made by any third party due to, or arising out of, your violation of these terms and conditions or your violation of any rights of another.<br>
    b) <strong>Purchase Features</strong>. Some applications offered by way of the Services or otherwise referenced on the FDI website may include the ability to make purchases within the application itself (also referred to as "in-app purchases"). This can include the ability to purchase additional content or access additional features without having to leave the application. The device on which you are accessing such applications may include settings that prevent access to certain features or content, which may allow you to turn off the ability to make in-app purchases. For example, Apple, Inc. outlines the steps required to enable restrictions on certain of its devices (currently at <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4213" target="_blank">http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4213</a>).

Accordingly, FDI shall exclusively own all now known or hereafter existing copyrights and all other intellectual property rights to all User Content of every kind and nature, in perpetuity, throughout the universe. To the extent that any of the above may be void or unenforceable, you agree that any and all User Content is hereby irrevocably assigned to FDI or its Third Party Providers, together with all intellectual property rights therein.
