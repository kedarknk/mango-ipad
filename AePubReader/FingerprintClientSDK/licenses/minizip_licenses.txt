crypt.h -- base code for crypt/uncrypt ZIPfile

Version 1.01e, February 12th, 2005

Copyright (C) 1998-2005 Gilles Vollant

This code is a modified version of crypting code in Infozip distribution

The encryption/decryption parts of this source code (as opposed to the
non-echoing password parts) were originally written in Europe.  The
whole source package can be freely distributed, including from the USA.
(Prior to January 2000, re-export from the US was a violation of US law.)

This encryption code is a direct transcription of the algorithm from
Roger Schlafly, described by Phil Katz in the file appnote.txt.  This
file (appnote.txt) is distributed with the PKZIP program (even in the
version without encryption capabilities).

If you don't need crypting in your application, just define symbols
NOCRYPT and NOUNCRYPT.

This code support the "Traditional PKWARE Encryption".

The new AES encryption added on Zip format by Winzip (see the page
http://www.winzip.com/aes_info.htm ) and PKWare PKZip 5.x Strong
Encryption is not supported.
