    "description": "Ralph wants a bicycle, but as everyone tells him, cows don't ride bicycles! His father unwittingly offers a glimmer of hope when he tells Ralph he can have a bicycle \"when pigs fly.\" But cows don't ride bikes and pigs don't fly, right? \"We'll soon see about that,\" says a determined Ralph. This enchanting award-winning picture book with vivid, witty illustrations shows young readers that sheer willpower can triumph over all the no's in the world.",
